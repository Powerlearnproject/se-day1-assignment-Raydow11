Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a fiedl of computer science that focuses on designing, developing, testing and maintaining software systems using structured methodologies, tools and principles. 
- Enables scalability:  builds systems that can grow and handle increasing workloads without performance issues
- Enhances security: Implement security protocols to protect data from cyber threats and esnures privacy.
- Increases efficiency: automates tasks, reduces manual work and improves overall productivity
  

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 - Mastering complexity and efficiency
 - Having a process
 - Mastering machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Planning: Identify the software requirement or purpose and scope
- Requirement analysis: Identify the final user specification
- Design: Buidling the framework
- Implementation (Coding): converting software design into tangible code
- testing: software undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix bugs, ensuring reliability and performance
- Deployment: The software is then released to users
- Maintenance: Continuosly monitor and update to fix bugs and improve performance

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- **Waterfall methodology**: Linear and sequential, rigid, detailed planning done upfront, client feedback is minimal and testing is done once development is complete.
- Example: Banking system where security and compliance require a well-defined and stable plan.
- **Agile methodology**: literative and incremental, highly flexible, regular customer feedback and continuous testing throughout the project.
- Example: Develpoing a mobile app startup where features and user feedback evolve frequently.
  

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks
- Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
- Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
  
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDE importance: Helps developers write code, allows real-time debugging, enables running and testing code, organizes files and provides additional functionalities such as database managegment.
- Examples of IDE: VS Code, PyCharm, etc
- VCS importance: multiple developers can work on the same codebase without overwriting each other's changes,  keeps hostory of all code changes, developers can create separate branches for new features, stores code in repositories.
- Examples of VCS:  Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Identifying and resolving errors in complex codebases can be time-consuming
- This can be fixed by using debugging tools provided by IDEs

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
- Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
-  System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
-  Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering: The practice of designing and optimizing input prompts to guide AI models in generating accurate, relevant and high  quality responses. It involves structurig prompts in a way that maximizes the AI's ability to understand and deliver useful outputs.
- Importance of prompt engineering: improves accruracy, enhances AI's creativity and problem-solving abilities, optimizes AI for different user cases and reduces ambiguity and bias


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Example of a vague prompt: "Tell me about technology"
- Improved prompt: Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on the healthcare industry,including its benefits, challenges and future potential.
- Why the improved prompt is more effective: More specific, clear objective, concide but detailed and reduces ambiguity
